Windows and MacOS compatibility

## Planned for next versions : 

Main menu :
- Options menu fully working :
	- Change language (english / french)
	- Save the changes for next start of the game
- Buttons to play / load / resume a game
		
## Known bugs :
- Two clicks are required to set the game in fullscreen for the first time (no problem if the game start in fullscreen). Also on mac, resolution at the start is slightly different. On first click, fullscreen doesn't activate but the resolution is set correctly.
- Click sound has a massive delay
- Background and menu element don't use all the space on some resolutions
